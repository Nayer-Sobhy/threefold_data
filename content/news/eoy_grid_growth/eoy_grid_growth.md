As reported in [Scott’s final grid stats update](https://forum.threefold.io/t/grid-stats-new-nodes-utilization-overview/3291/33?u=gosam) of the year, 2022 showed growth in both number of online nodes and utilization of that hardware.

<br/>

Via Scott, “Even with the growth of the Grid, we have seen utilization growth outpace it such that total utilization has also increased in percentage terms, though a bit less dramatically than the absolute numbers. Here’s to another year of growth for ThreeFold in 2023 🥂”
